Intel provides many licensed software packages, which all share the
same basic steps for configuring and installing, as well as license
management.

This build system is a work-in-progress. See
https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/4300 and
https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/7469 for more information.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spack interacts with Intel packages in three ways:

(1) Integrating as *external* tools,
(2) Installing as tools *internal* to Spack, and
(3) *Using* the tools to compile what we'll call *client packages* within Spack.

Conceivably, there is an auxiliary way that follows naturally from 2. like
any other regular Spack package, namely:

(4) Making the Spack-installed Intel tools available *external to Spack* for ad-hoc use.

This document aims to clarify the different ways and to document how to go about
using the tools in each way, focusing on 1. through 3.


Integration of Intel tools *external* to Spack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A site that already uses Intel tools, especially licensed ones, will likely
have some versions already installed on the system, especially at a time when
Spack is just being introduced. It will be useful to make such previously
installed tools available for use by Spack as they are.

External Intel *compilers*, like all compilers that Spack is to use, are to be
configured in ``compilers.yaml`` files located in ``$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/`` or
the user's own ``~/.spack/`` directory. Specifics for the Intel compilers are
discussed at
http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#intel-compilers .

External *library-type* packages (as opposed to compilers) are to be configured for
Spack in the files ``$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/packages.yaml`` or
``~/.spack/packages.yaml``, as documented at
http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#external-packages .

These ``packages.yaml`` files resolve a Spack spec via either ``paths`` or
``modules`` tokens to specific pre-installed package versions already on the system
that you wish to integrate.  Since Intel tools generally need environment
variables to interoperate, which cannot be conveyd alongside a bare ``paths``
specification, the ``modules`` token will be preferable.  Its
named modulefile, generated and managed outside of Spack's purview, will be
loaded when the corresponding spec is required within Spack when
compiling client packages.

The following example integrates the packages activated by the external
``intel-mkl/18/18.0.1`` and ``intel-mkl/18/18.0.2`` modulefiles as Spack
packages ``intel-mkl@2018.1.163`` and ``intel-mkl@2018.2.199``, respectively:

.. code-block:: yaml

   packages:
     intel-mkl:
       modules:
         intel-mkl@2018.1.163  arch=linux-centos6-x86_64:  intel-mkl/18/18.0.1
         intel-mkl@2018.2.199  arch=linux-centos6-x86_64:  intel-mkl/18/18.0.2

If your system administrator did not provide modules for the Intel tools
available, you could do well to ask for them, because installing multiple
copies of the Intel tools is bound to stretch disk space and patience thin. If
you *are* the system administrator and are still new to modules, then perhaps
it's best to follow the next section and install the Intel tools solely within
Spack.

A more advanced version follows, illustrating how to provide variants
and using the ``buildable: False`` declaration to disallow Spack to install
packages through its normal internal mechanism.

.. code-block:: yaml

   packages:
     intel-parallel-studio:
       modules:
         intel-parallel-studio@cluster.2018.1.163 +mkl+mpi+ipp+tbb+daal  arch=linux-centos6-x86_64:  intel/18/18.0.1
         intel-parallel-studio@cluster.2018.2.199 +mkl+mpi+ipp+tbb+daal  arch=linux-centos6-x86_64:  intel/18/18.0.2
       buildable: False

Installing Intel tools *within* Spack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation of Intel compilers and libraries *within* Spack.

Compilers always require a license - see Section Licenses below.

...


Using Intel tools to compile client packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once Intel packages are integrated as external package or installed within
Spack, they can be used as intended for installing *client packages* within
Spack.  There are actually three different routes for using
Intel packages:

* Compilers, as explicitly named the client spec in the form ``%intel@version``

    Needs editing ``compilers.yaml`` and always requires a license.
    ...

* Implicitly as virtual packages that satisfy a requirement for a library that
  is available in different flavors, namely BLAS, Lapack, and MPI.

  Intel packages can be selected either in the client package spec or by
  ``providers`` settings in ``packages.yaml``.
  ...

* As explicit dependency (DAAL, IPP â€“ TBD).
  ...


Licenses
~~~~~~~~~

Some of Intel's software products require a license, in particular
the core development packages of compilers, analyzers, and optimizers.
These are available in Spack as two packages:

* ``intel-parallel-studio`` - the entire suite,
* ``intel`` - a compilers-only subset.

Note that from 2017 onwards Intel made many of its performance libraries,
notably MPI and MKL, available for use without purchasing a license.

For packages that do require a license, it is needed not only during use, but
typically already at installation time.  If you plan on having Spack install
any such package, the Intel installer that Spack will run for you must be able
to find your license.

Therefore, *before* executing ``spack install intel-<pkg>``, provide the
license by one of the following means:


**License Server**

Setting up a license server as such is outside the scope of Spack. We assume
your system administrator has a license server running and has installed
network licenses for Intel packages.

To use an Intel license server client-side, e.g., by an Intel installer to
install licensed library packages or compilers, the client needs to find out or
be told the host name(s) and port number(s) of the license server, which can be
done by three methods, all described at
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/licensing-setting-up-the-client-floating-license .

Note, that ideally, your license administrator will *already have installed*
the necessary files to tell clients where to reach the server.

Notably, any files under ``/opt/intel/licenses/foo.lic`` that have the form::

  SERVER  hostname  hostid_or_ANY  portnum
  USE_SERVER

will be found automatically by client processess like installers and eventually
compilers and require no further action to use them.  While not particularly
recommended, even the actual network license files containing full PACKAGE and
INCREMENT data could be placed this way, as long as the ``USE_SERVER`` token is
present or has been added in the header.

Note that you can *install* a licensed product even when the actual FlexLM
server process is not running, by specifying the license server as ``export
INTEL_LICENSE_FILE=port@serverhost``.

...


**License File**

If you purchased a single-user license, obtain your license file as instructed
by Intel. You can request that the license file be re-sent to you `following
Intel's instructions
<https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/resend-license-file>`_.

For more, see:

* https://software.intel.com/en-us/faq/licensing
* https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/how-do-i-manage-my-licenses

The license file is always a plain text file whose name ends in ``.lic``.
Intel installers and compilers look for license files in several different
locations when they run:

** Default Intel location

If you can, i.e., you have write permission, create the directory
``/opt/intel/licenses/`` if it does not yet exist, and install your license
file with either the downloaded name or another suitably plain name that ends
in ``.lic`` in that directory.  This is the location that all Intel tools
inspect, and therefore preferred as no further action is needed.

** Alternative Intel location

If you cannot write to the default directory, but your system already has set
and manages the environment variable ``INTEL_LICENSE_FILE`` outside of Spack,
try to place your license file in a directory mentioned in this environment
variable if you have the necessary write permission. Make the license file
accessible to the licensed users only.

The Intel installer and compilers will search the default directory, then the
contents of the environment variable ``INTEL_LICENSE_FILE``.  Despite its name,
this is actually a PATH style variable that can hold a list of directories
(presumed to contain ``*.lic`` files), file names, or network locations in the
form ``port@host``, all separated by ":" (on Linux and Mac).

** Spack-managed location

If you cannot install your license file in Intel's default directory or a
location within a pre-existing ``INTEL_LICENSE_FILE`` variable, then Spack will
pursue a different approach: Spack will keep the license for you as a *global
license* under its own purview, specifically in the file
``$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/licenses/intel/license.lic``. After installing Intel
tools under Spack (route 2 above), Spack will place symbolic links to this file
in each directory where licensed Intel binaries are located.

Once Spack's global license file has been populated, no futher action from you
should be needed. To initialize the global license, *copy* your license file to
``$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/licenses/intel/license.lic``; create the ``intel``
directory if it does not yet exist.

...

When you run ``spack install intel-foo``, Spack will attempt to use the license locations
indicated above. If Spack cannot find a license, it will bring up an editor for a new
``$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/licenses/intel/license.lic`` and ask you to populate the file.
